## Description

This extension provides a clean and simple new tab page for Firefox. When a new tab is opened, it will display a calming background image and provide a search bar to quickly lookup sites or terms.

The background image automatically changes each time a new tab is opened to showcase beautiful scenery photographs. The search bar uses Firefoxâ€™s built-in search suggestions so you can easily access your most visited sites.

Additional features:

- Clean and minimal interface to avoid distractions
- Local storage caching of background images to limit data usage
- Fully customizable - change background images, search engines, text size and color
- Open source on GitHub
